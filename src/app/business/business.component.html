			<h2>Why should you use blockchain?</h2>
			<section>
				<article>
					<span></span>
					<h4>Optimization</h4>
					<p>Blockchain-based solutions optimize the business structure as a whole, accelerating transaction speed to a supersonic level. For example, verification and approval of documentation for international shipping would earlier take several months; now this is down to just a few minutes.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<span></span>
					<h4>Reduced risk & expenditure</h4>
					<p>Blockchain applications replace complete departments that are concerned only with forwarding and signing paperwork. Moreover, errors are brought down to zero.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<span></span>
					<h4>Transparency</h4>
					<p>Blockchain brings about trust since all operations within the ledger are open for inspection, while contract execution is clear and obligatory.</p>

			<h2>Key Benefits of the Apla Blockchain</h2>
			<section>
				<article>
					<span></span>
					<h4>Blockchain 3.0</h4>
					<p>We use “Smart Law” technology that operates above the level of protocols. Unlike Smart Contracts, Smart Laws can evaluate and rectify errors where there are program contradictions or flaws in the algorithm.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<span></span>
					<h4>Regulated ecosystem</h4>
					<p>The blockchain network is private and permissioned, meaning only those authorized can see or use information; it is also leak-proof.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<span></span>
					<h4>Rapid development</h4>
					<p>Apla is able to build entire systems in a matter of days, not months. Moreover, an intuitive interface coupled with simple syntax allows to train staff from local agencies easily.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<span></span>
					<h4>Independence</h4>
					<p>It gives the organization complete control over the platform and is also less dependent on the technology provider.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<span></span>
					<h4>Interface editor</h4>
					<p>It’s simple to use for any user, even those without a technical background.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<span></span>
