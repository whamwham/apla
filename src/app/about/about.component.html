			<h2>Our mission</h2>
			<p>By placing distributed ledger technology at the heart of digital transformation, we increase cyber security, reduce bureaucracy and replace legacy systems. With this, businesses and governments become more efficient.

				Smart implementation of blockchain redefines the trust we place in each other, making interactions more transparent, fair and reliable. This is why we will impact on the World Happiness Index, giving everyone access to knowledge, integrating developing countries into the global economy and <strong>bringing joy to people’s lives</strong>.
