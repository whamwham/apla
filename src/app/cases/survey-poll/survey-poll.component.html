      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>We developed an application that makes surveys and polls 100% reliable and much easier to conduct. The Blockchain Party of the Netherlands used it to raise awareness about the benefits of implementing blockchain for facilitating dialogue between the citizens and the government. During the survey, thousands of citizens answered more than 100 important questions via their mobile phones. The result was presented at the national parliament as an evidence of blockchain's capability to establish a clear and transparent connection between citizens and their political leaders.</p>
