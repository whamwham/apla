      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Entrepreneurs are an important driver of progress. But starting a new business is always complicated: it requires notarizing docs, opening bank accounts, paying fees and much more. In Ajman emirate (UAE) registering with local federal authorities includes applying paper documents to 4 to 5 different government services. It takes up to 10 working days and requires tons of paperwork.</p>
      <p>In April 2017, Administration of Ajman focused on helping businesses thrive in the economy using blockchain. Apla created a solution where every step of licensing can be completed digitally, at least 50% faster and easier than before. It also provides automatic data exchange between different departments and the highest level of security and transparency of all the administrative work.</p>
