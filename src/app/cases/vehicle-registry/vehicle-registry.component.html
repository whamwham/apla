			<h4>Summary</h4>
			<p>Apla developed a blockchain app for the Indian government which is able to optimize public sector employee work and increase the speed of registering a vehicle by 20 times. Due to the the masses amount of paperwork, the system took up to 60 days to complete registration. However, our solution allows citizens to pay all of the necessary state charges when purchasing a vehicle in just one click, instantly handing the system the full set of documents required and providing the user with a unique number. As such, the whole registration process can now be reduced to just three days.<br /><br />The app is integrated with the Amazon Rekognition ID system and this eradicates any identification number conflicts, whilst also allowing the police force to instantly identify drivers using a simple photograph they can take from their smartphone.</p>

		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Each of India’s vehicle registry departments works solely with paper documents. Registering a vehicle takes a lot of time: up to 2 months. Fraudulent behaviour often takes place, with cases of “migrating” one registration number onto another a common occurrence.</p>

			<p><strong>1.</strong>Authorized vehicle sellers photograph the buyer and enter the purchase details into a mobile app. The data entered includes relevant information about the vehicle from the manufacturer, such as engine number, type and color.</p>
			<p><strong>2.</strong>The purchaser’s identity is validated automatically via the Amazon Rekognition facial recognition system in partnership with the Aadhaar National identification system.</p>
			<p><strong>3.</strong>An appointed official registers the vehicle, issues the license plate and adds the data into the blockchain registry.</p>
			<p><strong>4.</strong>Police on the roads can instantly identify the vehicle and its owner by taking a photograph on a smartphone.</p>

		<p>Vehicle registry for the Indian government is the first practical case where we have tested out one of our latest features: the creation of a virtual dedicated ecosystem, which can work outside of the blockchain platform and receive data from external web services. Everything went swimmingly: we were able to connect to the Amazon Rekognition via API and make use of the facial recognition technology to identify vehicle owners.</p>
