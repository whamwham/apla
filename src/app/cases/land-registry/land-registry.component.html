			<h4>Summary</h4>
			<p>The Government of India is simplifying their services for customers by going digital and using blockchain technology. As part of this drive, in 2017 they decided to reinvent the land registry experience.</p>
			<p>After an exhaustive search for the right partner, the Government of Andhra Pradesh chose Apla to design &amp; engineer a new digital platform that could respond to modern needs &amp; behaviors.</p>
			<p>We partnered with the Government of India to design and develop the world’s first blockchain land registry proof of concept that meets the needs of modern citizens. We created a working prototype in just 8 days. It was well-received &amp; endorsed by the client. $700 million saved on bribes alone. Apla’s solution increases operational speeds by 10 times, decreases the number of paper documents from 3,000 to 1 and saves billions with improved process efficiency</p>

		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Bureaucracy in India is a constant for those buying or selling land.<br /><br />It takes months or even years to register one’s estate; it requires many papers, time &amp; money to do everything. Even then, you could lose money or land since it’s easy to falsify and alter entries in the land registry.</p>

		<h2>Why did the Indian Government use blockchain?</h2>
		<section>
			<article>
				<span></span>
				<h4>Secure data</h4>
				<p>Blockchain guarantees that any information can not be arbitrarily amended, altered or or deleted by any single individual.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<span></span>
				<h4>Transparent</h4>
				<p>It is easy to track actions made by every system user and define who is specifically responsible for each.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<span></span>
				<h4>Speed</h4>
				<p>Operational efficiency is increased hundreds of times.</p>

		<h2>Key Benefits of the Apla Blockchain</h2>
		<section>
			<article>
				<span></span>
				<h4>Blockchain 3.0</h4>
				<p>We use “Smart Law” technology that operate above the level of protocols. Unlike Smart Contracts, Smart Laws can evaluate and rectify errors where there are program contradictions or flaws in the algorithm.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<span></span>
				<h4>Regulated ecosystem</h4>
				<p>The blockchain network is private and permissioned, meaning only the government can see, use or alter information; it is also leak-proof.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<span></span>
				<h4>Rapid development</h4>
				<p>It took Apla just 8 days to build the entire system. Moreover, an intuitive interface coupled with simple syntax allows to train staff from local agencies easily.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<span></span>
				<h4>Independence</h4>
				<p>It gives government complete control over the platform and is also less dependent on the technology provider.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<span></span>
				<h4>Interface editor</h4>
				<p>It’s simple to use for any user, even those without a technical background.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<span></span>
				<h4>Cross-platform</h4>
				<p>Easy to use from desktop or any Android iOS devices.</p>
