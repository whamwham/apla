      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>As a national financial regulator, Luxembourg's Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) has always been friendly for the fintech innovations. In 2016 the country became the first in Europe to grant a state license to a cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
      <p>A year later, the CSSF was ready to explore the possibilities of using blockchain for selling traditional financial instruments. A european company that develops innovative financial products met Apla to deliver a comprehensive solution.</p>
      <p>In just 24 hours, Apla's team developed a system for banks to sell financial instruments to investors and verified it as a Proof-of-Concept. Our application integrated financial sector professionals, CSSF revisors and investors into a single safe, reliable and 100% transparent network.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Traditionally, the financial service industry relies on paper ledgers. This solution is time-consuming, expensive and insecure. Nevertheless, all the key operations, such as emitting financial instruments, their approval by national financial operator and selling to financial sector professionals, are still paper-based.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><u>Lack of transparency</u> during polls or surveys

        <li>The issuer <u>must inform the CSSF at least five days</u> before it intends to submit an application for approval
        <li>It can take <u>up to a month</u> for the CCSF to approve financial instruments
        <li>Companies admitting securities also <u>face delays due to inherent mistakes</u> and <u>spend money</u> on re-application
