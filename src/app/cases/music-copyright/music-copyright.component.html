      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Apla designed a digital Music Tracks Marketplace with automatic payments and copyright management. The system ensures the author receives fair compensation for each stream of their music, no matter if they are famous or completely unknown. The highest level of security and transparency is provided for music industry without any intermediaries.</p>
      <p>The application became part of the interactive installation called "The Spectrum" for the Bitbank stall at Sonic Visions Bar, Luxembourg. The Spectrum demo illustrated a collaborative creation cycle: from digital consolidated track to materialised digital rights. Every visitor was able to record their own music track and publish it on the digital marketplace, "sell" the rights and get paid. This deeply empowering experience helped people discover how DRM (Digital Rights Management) can evolve with the blockchain, and how it will simplify rights protection and facilitate monetization.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Copyright management is one of the biggest pain points in the music industry. Every time we hear a song, the author is supposed to get paid. But it's impossible to track billions of cases when a music composition is played on the radio, at a club or bar without paying the performance rights organizations.</p>
    <p>Digital monitoring doesn't help much to overcome piracy and lower both businesses' and artists' losses. Trials on unpaid royalties can last years because of difficulties in tracking where money was lost.</p>
